# INTRODUCTION

WHAT IS TENSORFLOW ?

IT IS A MACHINE LEARNING LIBRARY INTRODUCED BY GOOGLE.


WHAT IS MNIST DATA SET ?
IT IS A SUBSET OF NIST DATA SET WHICH CONTAINS(A-Z),(A-Z),(0-9) ALL BLACK AND WHITE IMAGES.

IT IS DATASET OF HANDWRITTEN DIGITS(0-9).

IT CONSIST OF 55000 TRAINING DATA AND 10000 TEST DATA.


DATA PREPROCESSING OF MNIST

INITIALLY THE IMAGES WERE NORMALIZED TO 20X20 PIXELS AND CENTERED , ALSO THEIR ASPECT RATIO WAS
MAINTAINED.

AFTER THIS STEP THEY WERE RESIZED TO 28X28 PIXELS IN ORDER TO GET BETTER ACCURACY AND DISTINCTION
BETWEEN THE BLACK AND WHITE PIXELS IN THE IMAGE.


# INPUT DATA

THE INPUT TO THE MODEL IS THE PIXEL DATA SHOWN AND THE ARRAY OF VALUES SHOWN ABOVE
THESE ARRAY VALUES ARE THE NUMBERS EACH IMAGE REPRESENT.

THE NUMBERS REPRESENTED BY THE ARRAY ARE STORED IN THE FORM OF 'ONE HOT ENCODING' I.E.
THE POSITION IN THE ARRAY WHERE ONE IS PRESENT REPRESENTS THE NUMBER PRRESENT IN THE IMEGES.
